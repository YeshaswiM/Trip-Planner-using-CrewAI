🔧 **BUCKET LIST ISSUE FIXED!**

## What Was Wrong:
- Bucket list mode was completing analysis but not displaying results
- The UI logic was trapped inside the status container
- No proper workflow for selecting and planning destinations

## What I Fixed:

### 1. 📋 **Proper Result Display**
- Weather analysis now displays OUTSIDE the status container
- Results are shown immediately after analysis completes
- Clear section headers for better navigation

### 2. 🎯 **Interactive Destination Selection**
- Multi-select widget for choosing destinations
- Default selection of top 3 destinations
- Clear instructions and help text

### 3. 🗺️ **Detailed Planning Workflow**
- Step-by-step process for bucket list planning
- Individual trip plans for each selected destination
- Progress tracking for multiple destination planning

### 4. 📤 **Download Options for Each Destination**
- Individual download buttons for each destination plan
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality per destination
- Proper file naming for multiple destinations

## New Bucket List Workflow:

1. **Select Mode**: Choose "📝 Bucket List (Multiple Destinations)"
2. **Enter Destinations**: Add destinations one per line
3. **Weather Analysis**: AI analyzes weather for all destinations
4. **View Rankings**: See weather-based recommendations
5. **Select Destinations**: Choose 2-3 for detailed planning
6. **Generate Plans**: Get complete trip plans for each
7. **Download/Share**: Individual download options per destination

## ✅ Now Working:
